          <p>Running a working group means to me, Hanno Seebens, to ensure an open and collaborative work environment. We all have different skills, expertise, backgrounds, and ideas, and we should all benefit from this by bringing this into the group thereby respecting alternative perspectives (see code of conduct). We may work on different projects and topics but I consider us as a team, although everybody will have a focus depending on the respective project. The team is much more powerful than the sum of individuals, and everybody should benefit from working in such a team. I expect group members (incl. the PI) to support each other wherever possible and necessary. I tried to put down my view on a healthy and productive working group in words in the following, although it might not capture nuances and requires reqular revision.</p>

            <ul>
              <li><b>Developing individual careers of group members is a priority.</b> While collaboration is key for success in science, the improvement of one's own skills and expertise is important and should not be forgotten. Most of you will work on a single project with specific goals, which need to be achieved. Thus, the development of skills and expertise should be tailored to the needs and wishes of the group member but at the same time should also align with the goals of the project. Although you will likely have specific project goals, there is usually enough flexibility to allow each group member to follow their own tasks or develop the project in a way that increases the benefits of the researcher. A benefit could be academic such as a scientific publication but more importantly should be the increase of knowledge, widening of perspectives, improving skills, and earning money (not to forget).</li>
              <br>
              <li><b>Science is our profession, not our hobby.</b> Most of us are doing science because we love it. Still, we should not forget that being a scientist is our profession rather than our hobby. Ultimately, we do that to earn money doing a job, which we like. We have time for work and time for private stuff. It is of course up to everybody’s own decision how much work and private aspects are intermixed but we should respect working times and leisure times. Although it can be expected that you invest time outside normal working times such as travelling to meetings and conferences in the evening or on a free day or investing more time before an important deadline, this should be the exception. We cannot expect per se that group members invest time outside working times, which also includes responding to emails or phone calls. Working over weekends and nights or travelling on free days should be avoided as much as possible. Working without a contract is a no-go (and not allowed officially). This, however, also implies that it can be expected that we work during work times, which includes responding to emails, attending meetings, and fulfilling duties. You are a professional scientist and you should take responsibility for your work and your work-life balance.</li>
              <br>
              <li><b>Respecting varying personalities and backgrounds is essential.</b> We all have different personalities and backgrounds and potentially come from different cultures. This inter-cultural exchange is one of the great advantages and joys of working in science. Hearing and learning from the diversity of people should be appreciated. It not only enriches each one’s perspective but also improves science and our scientific products including outreach. This, however, can only be achieved by respecting the different perspectives, skills, and ways of communication. Keep in mind that people are expressing themselves very differently, which may lead to confusion and misunderstanding. This can be resolved through communication, which is key. Talk to each other to learn how others think and behave and to avoid misunderstandings. </li>
              <br>
              <li><b>Communication is key!</b> Collaborations can only be fruitful and efficient if we communicate appropriately. This relates to discussions, where everybody should have the opportunity to express ideas and concerns, but also includes direct communication spoken or in words. Consider that this also applies to digital conversation including text messages and emails. If you get a message or email, please respond in time even if it is just an “OK”. If you are unsure whether this is worth addressing, do it nevertheless. Do not wait for others (incl. me) approaching you or bringing up the topic. It is also in your responsibility to start a communication. Please respect that not everybody is able to express themselves in a perfect way and that English is not the first language for most of us.</li>
              <br>
              <li><b>Give credit where credit is due.</b> Working collaboratively means sharing and discussing ideas, code and data, supporting others by giving advice and cross-reading text, and many other forms of support. Any form of support should be credited appropriately. This includes saying ‘thank you’ but also offering co-authorships. While a ‘thank you’ is always appropriate, a co-authorship should be considered when a substantial contribution was provided. What a ‘substantial contribution’ actually is, needs to be discussed in each individual case. The potential for becoming a co-author on a scientific paper, report, policy brief, talk, or other releases should be defined as early as possible ideally at the very beginning of a study. If many people are potentially involved, it is good practice to define and communicate an authorship policy early on in the process so that everybody is aware of what needs to be done to become an author.</li>
              <br>
              <li><b>Publishing and authorship policy.</b> Insights gained while working on a project in the research group should be made available to others outside the group. This is usually done by publishing peer-reviewed articles in scientific journals. While such articles represent an important component for academic careers, they might be of less interest for others. Personally, I am open to alternative ways of publishing information and I do not insist on scientific publications if alternatives can be found. Still, I encourage every group member to work towards scientific publications, which provide a standard way for reaching out to the scientific community and may also be relevant for policymakers. If a publication is planned, authorships should be inclusive and everybody who contributed should be invited to become a co-author. However, an authorship needs to be justified by some kind of contribution to data collection, analysis, and/or writing. Potential co-authors should be contacted early on rather than at an advanced stage which raises the impression of just increasing the author team on paper. All decisions concerning the publication process must be communicated openly to all co-authors.</li>
              <br>
              <li><b>Everybody is responsible for their behaviour and career.</b> I support everybody as much as I can in developing their career further in whatever way the person envisioned it to be, but ultimately everybody is responsible for their career and in achieving goals either set personally or by the project. I can and will provide support wherever I can but whether or not the person is willing to accept the support is outside my hands. A serious disagreement and a lack of consensus about our way of collaboration may ultimately result in the lack of achieving goals.</li>
              <br>
              <li>Group members are encouraged to <b>develop and work on their own ideas</b> even if these deviate from the project’s goals as long as this work does not interfere with or jeopardise the goals of the project. Group members may devote 10-20% of work time on their side project if this does not affect the project and is communicated to me. My most successful publication started with such a side project. Be open and follow your interests.</li>
              <br>
              <li>The research conducted in the lab should adhere to the <b>principles of open science and FAIR data</b>. The principles for good collaboration also apply to interactions outside the working group. Thus, insights gained, data generated, tools developed should be shared and provided as much as possible and sensible. It has to be evaluated for each piece of research whether or not this indeed needs to be shared (not all is useful for others), but the major products of a study should be made available beyond a scientific publication.</li>
              <br>
              <li><b>Working hybrid requires extra rules.</b> Our way of collaboration is more and more done remotely with little time spending together physically. This is a great advancement and provides much flexibility in terms of working times and places. I will support this flexibility as much as I can and will take advantage of it myself. However, remote collaborations can only be successful by regular exchange through e.g. exchanging emails or online meetings. I therefore expect everybody to respond to emails in time and to meet with the group at least twice a week: One shorter meeting at the beginning of the week to plan for the week and one longer at the end of the week. During these meetings everybody should have the opportunity to speak up and to provide a brief summary of ongoing work and issues. You may think that this is too time consuming but collaboration can only be achieved if we create opportunities, which is particularly important while working remotely. And keep in mind that the time saved by avoiding commuting is much more than the time spent in our group meetings. </li>
              <br>
              <li><b>Respect deviating from rules of collaboration.</b> Some individuals may have already developed their own full research profile and agenda, which they would like to push. It might also be that somebody is under time pressure and needs to accomplish before a deadline. In rare cases, it might be sensible to focus only on their project goals without any interest in collaboration with other group members. Although I cannot recommend such behaviour, I respect such decisions as long as it does not conflict with the code of conduct and the principles of open science and FAIR data. Thus, deviating from the outlined points may be acceptable to some degrees, which, however, needs to be discussed and evaluated individually.</li>
