          <p>The overall aim of PredictiveAliens is to improve our understanding and predictions of biological invasions over large temporal and spatial scales. To achieve this, we will first quantify flows of alien species, driver dynamics and biases globally. We will build new databases of alien species spread to investigate the flows of spread. We will adapt models from economics to simulate networks of driver dynamics, which in turn can be used to investigate the underlying mechanisms of alien species spread. To account for biases, we will develop new measures for quantifying data gaps and uncertainties, which will be included in the analysis. </p>
          <p>The project consists of a DFG Heisenberg position (Hanno Seebens), a postdoc (Philipp Laeseke), and a phd position (Manuela Gómez-Suárez).</p></div>
