              <li><b>We do not tolerate any form of harassment or discrimination</b> by and/or of members of our group in any form. If you experience or witness such behaviour, please reach out to the group leader, Hanno Seebens. If this is not possible or not wished, you may contact the Central Women's and Equal Opportunities Office of the university (https://www.uni-giessen.de/de/org/beauftragte/fgb) or their representatives at each floor and institute of the university.</li>
              <li><b>All communication in any form should be appropriate</b> (sexual or discriminatory language and imagery is not appropriate at any time). Our communication is kind and respectful to others in all situations of our work including meetings, emails, social media etc.</li>
              <li><b>Respect other's way of working</b>, parcitularly if you are sharing an office with others. Avoid long chats or phone calls outside work discussions. These could be done outside the office. Try to discuss and define rules of behaviour to achieve a comfortable working atmosphere for everybody in the office. This may include tiny little things like opening the window, turning on/off the heating, watering the plants but also extensive private chats on phone.</li>

              <li><b>Meetings:</b></li>
              <li>To make meetings efficient, useful and pleasant, please follow these recommendations:</li>
            </ul>
            <ul>
              <li>Be on time</li>
              <li>Be an active listener (be present physically and mentally)</li>
              <li>Pay attention (checking messages during a meeting is fine but starring constantly on your mobile or laptop is impolite and generates the impression of not participating)</li>
              <li>Be respectful and polite in the discussions (consider the code of conduct)</li>
              <li>Let other people speak</li>
              <li>Come prepared (e.g., think ahead of what you would like to report; set up your presentation if you are supposed to give one) </li>
            </ul>
            This applies to physical and online meetings.
