            <p>The group is working as a team, which requires having a common understanding of how we should behave in such a team. This involves working in collaboration on a scientific project but also communication among team members and behaviour within the group irrespective of scientific collaboration. The following set of rules should give some guidances how this is expected for group members. The rules are phrased as bullet points for easy digest, while a more detailed explanation can be found under 'Lab philosophy'. Note that this selection of rules is not extensive.</p>
